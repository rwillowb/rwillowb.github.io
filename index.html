<h1>Introducing Queen Willow</h1>

<p><em>I have dedicated this site to my beloved (and pain in the butt) cat Willow </em>&#x1F431;</p>

<p>
Will was born May 2015 and had lived with 1 family prior to being surrendered to a shelter in early 2016. In June of 2016 I had visited the now 
closed animal shelter in Gatineau, QC and decided to adopt this little nugged of joy that day.
Since then, Willow has been my loyal companion and I can't imagine where I'd be without her.
