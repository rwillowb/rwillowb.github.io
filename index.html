	<!-- History of my cat, and how I came to welcome her into my life June of 2016 -->
	<p1>Willow was born May 2015 and had lived with 1 family prior to being surrendered to a shelter in early 2016. In June of 2016 I had visited the now 
	closed animal shelter in Gatineau, QC and decided to adopt this little nugget of joy that day.
	Since then, Willow has been my loyal companion and I can't imagine where I'd be without her (and her many, many hairballs).</p1>

	<!-- I think it's always a good idea for a potential pet owner to do some research on the type of pet they're interested in to ensure they're the right animal for you! -->
	<p1> Some of the things Willow loves are to run around like she snorted 6 grams of refined catnip and then crash on the rug shortly afterwards.
	She is truly a unique cat, and if you find yourself in a place where a cat may seem like the right companion for you I suggest researching if a cat is the right fit for you! 
	I used the below link to as a reference to help me make the right decision to adopt Willow.</p1>
